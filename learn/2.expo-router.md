Component I've Learnt

1. Link
2. Slot
3. Stack

---

1. "scheme" act as deeplink in the app
   when setting up the schema it use to as
   "scheme://{route}"

2. Link Tag similar to A Tag or Link in Tanstack router

   - href

3. Slot = content in the web
4. Stack = build the top header - New concept
   - default is self enclosing Tag
   - can be customize to open and close tag
     - Global option: screenOptions = {}
       - headerStyle: {} // the whole block of header
       - headerTintColor: {} //the text back/forward
     - Screen Registering: Stack.Screen name="{screenName}"
       option={}
       - title : "{customHeader}"
       - hide header: headerShown: false
5. StatusBar

LAYOUT CONCEPT

- When we don't have the "\_layout.jsx" the expo-router use the "index.jsx"

- When we have the "\_layout.jsx" the expo-router use the "\_layout.jsx" first

think of View = Div

Component I learn

1. View
2. Text
3. StyleSheet
4. Image
5. Pressable

1. type of component
   1. full page component
   2. custom component - reusable
   3. native/built-in component
2. View component inherit the flex box automatically as column

To style react native can use

1.  native wind - use tailwind in react native
2.  style component library
3.  use built-in stylesheet api
    1. StyleSheet.create({})
    2. Inline style
4.  Join Style using the StyleSheet.create({}) and the inline Style with the array in the styles property of the native component
5.  Pressable - like the element with normal state and hover state
    - pressed - function destructering
    - onPress

Image

1. use "source" not "src" like in the web
2. for external image use 'source={uri: "externalphoto"}'
3. for internal image use path
   \\\* Tips 'import as {NAME} from "path"' -> use the NAME as the value to store in the "source={NAME}"
